				"description": "<p>Cleveland&lsquo;s Health Line BRT, which opened on 2008, connects downtown Cleveland with University Circle, the region&lsquo;s second largest employment center, focusing on the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University. The line, which primarily runs in transit-only lanes in the center of Euclid Avenue, runs every 10 minutes and generates more riders than any other line in the system. Within its first few years of operation, weekday ridership on the Euclid Avenue corridor increased from 8,900 passenger trips to 14,500 passenger trips. It currently carries over 16,000 weekday passenger trips.There are 36 stations along the 9.4-mile line, which consolidated over 100 stops on the previous local route. The Health Line alignment transitions to curbside operation in downtown and University Circle, using exclusive, transit-only lanes. The project cost was $168 million. The Federal Transit Administration&lsquo;s New Starts program contributed 50 percent of the cost. Other sources included the Ohio Department of Transportation ($50 million), the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, and the City of Cleveland. Naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Medical Center, helping to off-set operating costs of the line.</p>",

The entire U.S. 36 project, including expressway and transit improvements, cost $438 million (2015). It was built as a public-private partnership, with toll revenue serving as the primary revenue stream. The Colorado Department of Transportation secured a TIFIA loan from the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998. The transit service is called the Flatiron Flyer (named after a mountain range near Boulder). The BRT line serves six stations with &rdquo;all-stops&ldquo; and express service.

It is currently one of three busways in the Pittsburgh area. The original segment of the East Busway opened in 1983 with a capital cost of $156 million (1983). The busway was extended to its current length in 2003 at a cost of $69 million (2002). Under funding programs available at that time, 80 percent of the cost was federally-funded (current federal participation in major transit projects is currently 50 percent or less.) The East Busway operates along a former freight rail right-of-way. It consists of a 9-mile long, two lane roadway for buses, with added lanes at stations. The addition lanes allow buses to bypass stations and maintain high speeds. Several different service patterns are operated, including a frequent line that stops at all stations and runs to downtown: a similar route that connects the busway with Pittsburgh&lsquo;s second largest employment and activity center, Oakland; and various expressway routes from different stations. Stations at the eastern end include park & ride facilities. The busway allows buses to bypass congested streets and highways, and provide a rapid connection from the city&lsquo;s easternmost neighborhoods to downtown and Oakland. The combined services that operate on the busway carry 25,600 weekday passenger trips.</p>",

				"description": "<p>There are currently over 10 modern streetcar lines in the U.S. that have opened since 2000 or are under construction. Streetcars are used primarily in dense urban settings and are considered as much an economic development tool as a mode of transportation. The newest line is also the first suburban streetcar, located in Orange County, California, in the Los Angeles metro region.</p><p>To complement Orange County&lsquo;s commuter rail service, passengers needed a way to get to their final destination after getting off a train. After evaluating many alternatives and extensive outreach, a 4.5-mile streetcar line was chosen as the preferred alternative. Expected to begin operations in 2021, the OC Streetcar will link the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center, which provides regional rail, local bus, and intercity services, to a new multimodal hub in Garden Grove. The cost of the project is $408 million, with $125 million provided by the Federal Transit Administration&lsquo;s Small Starts program. Other funding sources in the California Department of Transportation and regional and local jurisdictions.</p>",
